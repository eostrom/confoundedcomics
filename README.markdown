Confounded Comics
=================

This is the code that runs comics.confoundedcontraptions.com. It has
a simple books/pages model (although it currently supports only one
book per site), browsing, and an Atom feed.

The admin UI was built with Hobo, while learning Hobo. The front end
is standard Rails, with Haml.
