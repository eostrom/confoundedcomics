Description:

    Creates a subsite, a namespaced section of your application.

    The subsite will use app/views/taglibs/<subsite_name>_site.dryml
    instead of app/views/taglibs/appplication.dryml.  This allows you
    to easily set different themes and choose different CSS files for
    the subsite.

    Controllers for the subsite are created in
    app/controllers/<subsite_name>/ and views are also in their own
    subdirectory.   This allows you to have two different controllers
    and two different sets of views for the same model.

    The difference between hobo_admin_site and hobo_subsite is that
    hobo_admin_site limits the subsite to use by administrators only.
